- Every value in Rust is of a certain _data type_, which tells Rust what kind of data is being specified so it knows how to work with that data.

```rust
let x: i32 = 6; // x is a 32-bit signed integer
```

# Scaler Types

- A _scalar_ type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters.
