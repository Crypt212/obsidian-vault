But **advanced resources assume foundational knowledge**. Without that foundation, you'll:\n\n- Misunderstand critical concepts\n    \n- Waste time on irrelevant administrative tasks\n    \n- Feel constantly confused and inadequate\n    \n- Probably give up entirely\n    \n\n## Your Action Plan Starting TODAY\n\n1. **Put \"Master PostgreSQL 17\" on your \"Read Later\" shelf** - it's for Future You\n    \n2. **Get \"Learning SQL\" or start with PostgreSQL Tutorial**\n    \n3. **Set up your practice environment** (PostgreSQL + sample database)\n    \n4. **Apply your Obsidian method to SQL** - but with QUERIES, not just notes\n    \n\nmarkdown\n\n# SQL Learning Vault Structure\n\n## Basic Queries\n- SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY\n- **My Practice Queries:** [3-5 queries you wrote]\n- **Common Mistakes:** [Things you got wrong]\n\n## JOINs\n- INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN\n- **Real Problem:** \"Find customers with their orders\"\n- **My Solution:** [Your query here]\n- **What I Learned:** [Reflection]\n\n## Aggregations\n- GROUP BY, HAVING\n- **Business Question:** \"Who are our top 10 customers by revenue?\"\n- **My Query:** [Your solution]\n\n## The Truth About \"Mastering\" Skills\n\nMastery comes from **progressive overload**, not jumping to advanced topics. You wouldn't try to bench press 300lbs on your first day at the gym. Similarly, you need to build your SQL \"muscles\" with appropriately challenging exercises.\n\n**Your goal for the next month:** Become so comfortable with fundamental SQL that the preface of \"Master PostgreSQL 17\" sounds obvious and boring. Then, and only then, should you open it.\n\nYou have the discipline from your Obsidian work. Now channel that into **deliberate practice** rather than **premature advanced study**. The advanced book will be there waiting when you're truly ready for it."}
