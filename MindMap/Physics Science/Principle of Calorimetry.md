- **Heat**: energy transferred between two bodies due to difference in temperature.
- ***1 Calorie***: The amount of energy needed to rise the temperature of *1 gm* of water from *14.5 Celsius* to *15.5 Celsius* at *1 atm* pressure.
$$
1 Cal = 4.186 joule
$$
- The amount of heat lost/gained with temp difference in a body with mass *m* is:-
$$
Q = m\times s \times \Delta T
$$
- *s* is the **specific heat of body material**.
$$
Q = n\times C \times \Delta T
$$
- *n* is the number of molecules and *C* is the **molar heat of body material**.
- *m * s* is called the **heat capacity of body**.
- **water equivalent of body**: is the mass of water having same **heat capacity** as given body.

# Latent Heat
- **Specific Latent Heat of Fusion**: is a constant that can determine the amount of heat energy to melt or vaporise material based on its mass, while its temperature remains constant, it is denoted by *L*.
$$
Q = m \times L
$$
