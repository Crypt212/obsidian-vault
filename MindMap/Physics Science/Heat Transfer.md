- There are three ways to transfer heat:-
# Conduction

- **Heat Conduction**: is the process where heat i transferred due to molecules collisions.
- **Thermal Conductivity(k)**: is the ability of material to conduct heat.
- When a rod has its ends fixed at temperatures T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub>, and cross section of rod is of area A, and length (thickness) between the too ends be x, and the rod reaches stability (meaning the heat transfer rate at every point in the rod is uniform):-
$$\frac {\Delta Q}{\Delta t} = -kA\times\frac{T_1 - T_0}x$$
- **Thermal Resistance** (R): is the resistance of the metrical to conduct heat.
$$\begin{equation}R = \frac {x} {kA} \rightarrow \frac {\Delta Q}{\Delta t} = - \frac {(T_1 - T_0)} R\end{equation}$$
- When 2 or more rods connected in ***series*** with different resistances:-
$$R_{equivalent} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + ...$$
- When 2 or more rods connected in ***parallel*** with different resistances:-
$$\frac 1 R_{equivalent} = \frac 1 R_1 + \frac 1 R_2 + \frac 1 R_3 + ...$$
## Searle's apparatus:-
- This is a device to measure thermal conductivity of a solid.

- Water used to keep temperature T<sub>2</sub> at a specific value by absorbing heat, collect it in a beaker after t time, the Amount of heat it loses in that time is:-
$$Q = m \times s_{water} \times (T_3 - T_4)$$
- The transferred heat inside the rod after time t is:-
$$Q = k \times A \times \frac {T_1 - T_2} {x} \times t$$
- Combine the equations, you get the conductivity of the solid (k):-
$$k = \frac {x \times m \times s_{water} \times (T_3 - T_4)} {A \times t \times (T_1 - T_2)}$$

# Convection
- Is a process of transferring heat through the motion of the heated material itself.
- **Forced Convection** is convection when material is forced to move (like a bump).
- **Natural/Free Convection** is convection when material is moved by differences in density.
$$\frac {\Delta Q}{\Delta t} = -kA\Delta T$$
# Radiation
- Refers to the process of emitting, transmitting, and receiving energy through space.
- Also refers to the energy emitted through space.

## Black Body
- Is a body that absorbs all radiations falling on it.
## Black Body Radiation
- Is the radiations emitted by black body.
- **Emissive Power**: The amount of energy radiated per area per time per solid angle
$$E= \frac {\Delta U} {\Delta t \times \Delta A \times \Delta \omega}$$
- **Absorptive Power**: The ratio of absorbed power to all indecent power.
$$a = \frac {absorbed\ power} {incedent\ power}$$
- **Kirchhoff's Law**:
$$\frac {E_{body}} {a_{body}} = E_{black\ body}$$
- **Stefan-Boltzmann's Law**:
$$P = \sigma \times A \times T^4$$
$$P = energy\ of\ radiation\ per\ unit\ time$$
$$\sigma = stefen-boltzmann\ constant = 5.67\times 10^{-8}\frac W {m^2\times K^4}$$
- For body that *isn't* perfect black body:-
$$P = e \times \sigma \times A \times T^4$$
$$ e = emissivity\ of\ body,\ 0\lte$$
