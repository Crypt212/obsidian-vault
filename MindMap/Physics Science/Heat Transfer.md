- There are three ways to transfer heat:-
# Conduction

- **Heat Conduction**: is the process where heat i transferred due to molecules collisions.
- **Thermal Conductivity**: is the ability of material to conduct heat.

$$\begin{equation}
\frac {\Delta Q}{\Delta t} = -kA\frac{\ T}{}
\end{equation}$$
# Convection
# Radiation
