- There are three ways to transfer heat:-
# Conduction

- **Heat Conduction**: is the process where heat i transferred due to molecules collisions.
- **Thermal Conductivity(k)**: is the ability of material to conduct heat.
- When a rod has its ends fixed at temperatures T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub>, and cross section of rod is of area A, and length (thickness) between the too ends be x, and the rod reaches stablity (meaning the heat transfer rate at every point)

$$\begin{equation}
\frac {\Delta Q}{\Delta t} = -kA\times\frac{T_1 - T_0}x
\end{equation}$$
- **Thermal Resistance** (R): is the resistance of the metrical to conduct heat.
$$\begin{equation}
R = \frac {x} {kA} \rightarrow 
\frac {\Delta Q}{\Delta t} = - \frac {(T_1 - T_0)} R
\end{equation}$$
