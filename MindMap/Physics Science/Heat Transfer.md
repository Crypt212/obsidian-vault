- There are three ways to transfer heat:-
# Conduction

- **Heat Conduction**: is the process where heat i transferred due to molecules collisions.
- **Thermal Conductivity(k)**: is the ability of material to conduct heat.
- When a rod has its ends fixed at temperatures T_1 and T_2

$$\begin{equation}
\frac {\Delta Q}{\Delta t} = -kA\times\frac{T_1 - T_0}x
\end{equation}$$
- **Thermal Resistance** (R): is the resistance of the metrical to conduct heat.
$$\begin{equation}
R = \frac {x} {kA} \rightarrow 
\frac {\Delta Q}{\Delta t} = - \frac {(T_1 - T_0)} R
\end{equation}$$
