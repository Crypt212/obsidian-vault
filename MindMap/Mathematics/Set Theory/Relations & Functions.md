# Binary Relation
- A binary relation between sets A and B is a subset of the Cartesian product $A\times B$.

# Function
- A function $f:A \rightarrow B$ is a **binary relation** between A and B where every element of A is mapped once with an element of B.
- **Domain**: is the set of input elements A.
- **Co-Domain**: is the set of all possible outputs B.
- **Range**: is subset of B for which elements are actually mapped from A.
## Types of Functions
### One-to-One (Injective)
- A function where each element of A is mapped to a unique element of B.
- **Insight**: $\#A \leq \#B$ 
### Onto (Surjective)
- A function where each element of B are mapped to some elements of A.
- ie, Co-domain = Range
- **Insight**: $\#A \geq \#B$ 
### Bijective
- A Function that is b
