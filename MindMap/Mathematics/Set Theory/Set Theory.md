- **Set** is a collection of distinct objects, objects does not repeat inside a set.
- There are 2 ways to describe a **set**:
	- **Roster Form**: all set elements are mentioned inside the set, example:
$$S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$$
> For sets containing infinite numbers, we set some of the elements then put `...`.

$$ S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, ..., -1, -2, -3, -4, ...\}$$
	- **Set-Builder Form**: set is expressed with some relations that hold across all its elements, example:
$$ S = \{x: x = a^3, a \in N, 3 \lt a \lt 5 \}$$
