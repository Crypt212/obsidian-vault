- **Set** is a collection of distinct objects, objects does not repeat inside a set.
- There are 2 ways to describe a **set**:
	- **Roster Form**: all set elements are mentioned inside the set (and `...` for infinite sets), examples:
$$S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$$
$$ S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, ..., -1, -2, -3, -4, ...\}$$
	- **Set-Builder Form**: set is expressed with some relations that hold across all its elements, example:
$$ S = \{x: x = a^3, a \in N, 3 \lt a \lt 5 \}$$
# Cardinality
- Cardinality is the number of elements in a set, represented by $|S|$ for a set $S$.
# Empty Set
- Sets with no elements are said to equal $\phi$.
# Properities
- A set $A$ is a **subset** of another set $B$ if the elements of the $A$ are all present in $B$, this is represented as $A \subseteq B$.
- A set $A$ is a **strict subset** of another set $B$ if the elements of the $A$ are all present in $B$ but $A \not= B$ , this is represented as $A \subseteq B$.
