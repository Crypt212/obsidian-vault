#tool
- **Prettier** is a *code formatter*.
- Its primary purpose is to automatically enforce a consistent style across your code.
# What Prettier Does
1. **Automatic Formatting:** You give Prettier your messy, inconsistently styled code, and it instantly returns clean, uniformly formatted code.
2. **Opinionated:** Prettier is famously (and sometimes controversially) opinionated. It has very few configuration options. The philosophy is: "Just let Prettier decide." This ends all "tabs vs. spaces," "semicolon or no semicolon" arguments by having a single, automated standard.
3. **Language Support:** It supports a vast array of languages beyond just JavaScript, including:
    - [[JavaScript]] (including ES2017+, JSX)
    - [[Typescript]]
    - [[CSS]], [[SCSS]], Less
    - [[HTML]], [[MindMap/Software Engineering/Languages/Javascript/JSON]], [[Markdown]]
    - [[GraphQL]], [[YAML]]
    - and many more.
# Benefits
- Makes it much more readable and eliminating all debates about code style within a team.
