# AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)
- 
# XMLHttpRequest (XHR)
The **`XMLHttpRequest`** object (often called **XHR**) is a built-in tool in JavaScript.

ðŸ‘‰ It allows your web page to **talk to a server**:
- You can *ask for* data (fetch information).
- You can *send* data (like form details).
- And all this happens *without reloading the entire page*.
This was one of the first ways to make web pages dynamic and is the foundation of AJAX.
