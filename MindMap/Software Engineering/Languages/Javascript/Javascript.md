# AJAX
- AJAX stands for **Asynchronous JavaScript and XML**, it's a set of web development techniques that allows a web page to communicate with a server **without reloading the entire page**.
- This creates a much faster and smoother user experience, similar to a desktop application.
- The process relies on a JavaScript object called the `XML[[XHR]] or the newer, more powerful *[[Fetch API]]*. Hereâ€™s the typical flow:
	1)  **An Event Occurs:** Something happens on your web page.
	2) **Create an AJAX Request:** JavaScript creates an `XMLHttpRequest` object or uses the `fetch()` function.
	3) **Send the Request:** The request is sent to a web server.
	4) - **Server Processes the Request:** The server receives the request, does something, and prepares a response, usually in **[[JSON]]** or **[[XML]]** format.
# XHR (`XMLHttpRequest`)
- The **`XMLHttpRequest`** object (often called **XHR**) is a built-in tool in JavaScript.

- It allows your web page to **talk to a server**:
	- You can *ask for* data (fetch information).
	- You can *send* data (like form details).
	- And all this happens *without reloading the entire page*.
- This was one of the first ways to make web pages dynamic and is the foundation of AJAX.
