# AJAX
- AJAX stands for **Asynchronous JavaScript and XML**, it's a set of web development techniques that allows a web page to communicate with a server **without reloading the entire page**.
# XMLHttpRequest (XHR)
- The **`XMLHttpRequest`** object (often called **XHR**) is a built-in tool in JavaScript.

- It allows your web page to **talk to a server**:
	- You can *ask for* data (fetch information).
	- You can *send* data (like form details).
	- And all this happens *without reloading the entire page*.
- This was one of the first ways to make web pages dynamic and is the foundation of AJAX.
