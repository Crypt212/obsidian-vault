# AJAX
- AJAX stands for **Asynchronous JavaScript and XML**, it's a set of web development techniques that allows a web page to communicate with a server **without reloading the entire page**.
- This creates a much faster and smoother user experience, similar to a desktop application.
- The process relies on a JavaScript object called the *[[XHR]]* or the newer, more powerful *[[Fetch API]]*.
> Note that it supports [[XML]], [[JSON]] and many more, the name is just historical.
# XHR (`XMLHttpRequest`)
- The **`XMLHttpRequest`** object (often called **XHR**) is a built-in tool in JavaScript that allows your web page to **talk to a server** using [[HTTP]] protocol.
# Fetch API
- The **`fetch`** method is a *modern* built-in tool in JavaScript that allows your web page to **talk to a server** using [[HTTP]] protocol, it uses [[promises]].
