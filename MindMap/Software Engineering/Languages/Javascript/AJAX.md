- AJAX stands for **Asynchronous JavaScript and XML**, it's a set of web development techniques that allows a web page to communicate with a server **without reloading the entire page**.
- This creates a much faster and smoother user experience, similar to a desktop application.
- The process relies on a JavaScript object called the *[[XHR]]* or the newer, more powerful *[[Fetch API]]*.
> Note that it supports [[XML]], [[JSON]] and many more, the name is just historical.
