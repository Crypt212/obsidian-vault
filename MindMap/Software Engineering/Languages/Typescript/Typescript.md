- It's basically [[JavaScript]] with strict-typing added to it.
# Setup
- We need to install some packages:-
### `typescript` (The Compiler/Language)

- **What it is:** This is **the core package**. It's the TypeScript language itself, which includes two key things:
    1. **The Compiler Tool (`tsc`)**: The program that converts your `.ts` files into `.js` files.
    2. **The Language Service**: The "brains" that provides code analysis, error checking, and editor features like autocomplete and refactoring tools. This is what powers your IDE's TypeScript intelligence.
