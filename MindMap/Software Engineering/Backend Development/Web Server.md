# Web Server Architectures

- The structure and design of a web server.

## Single-Tier Architecture (Single Server)

- A single server is responsible for handling and processing requests and serving web content.
- Used for small websites.
- Limited by scalability and single point of failure.
- Examples: [[Apache]]

- Workload is distributed across multiple servers.
- This approach often involves load-balancers that evenly distribute incoming requests across a cluster of web servers.
- Examples: [[Nginx]]
