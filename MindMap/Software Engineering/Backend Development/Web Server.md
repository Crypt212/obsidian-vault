- Is some a computer hardware and underlying software that stores, processes and serves web content.
- Web servers operate on the Hypertext Transfer Protocol [[HTTP]], which is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web.

# Web Server Architectures

- The structure and design of a web server.

## Single-Tier Architecture (Single Server)

- A single server is responsible for handling and processing requests and serving web content.
- Used for small websites.
- Limited by scalability and single point of failure.
- Examples: [[Apache]]

## Multi-Tier Architecture (Load Balance)

- Workload is distributed across multiple servers.
- This approach often involves load-balancers that evenly distribute incoming requests across a cluster of web servers.
- Examples: [[Nginx]]

## Features of Web Servers

Web servers offer a range of features, including:

- **Content Hosting :** They store and serve web content, including HTML pages, images, videos, and other multimedia files.
- **Security :** Web servers implement various security mechanisms to protect against unauthorized access and cyberattacks.
- **Load Balancing :** Some web servers can distribute incoming traffic across multiple server instances to ensure optimal performance and availability.
- ****Logging and Monitoring :**** They provide tools to track and analyze server performance, user access, and error logs.
- ****Caching :**** Web servers can cache frequently accessed content to reduce server load and improve response times.
