- **Dimensionallity reduction** transforms high-dimensional data into a meaningful representation in a lower-dimensional space.
- Benefits include improved visualization, computational efficiency, and better model performance by eliminating noise and redundancy while preserving essential patterns.

# Common Techniques You Might Encounter
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** - finds the directions of maximum variance
- **t-SNE, UMAP** - great for visualization
- **Feature Selection** - simply removing unimportant features (the simplest form)
