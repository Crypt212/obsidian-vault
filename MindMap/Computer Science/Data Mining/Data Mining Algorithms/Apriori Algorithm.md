- this is an algorithm used for search association rules in a frequent itemset.
# History
- this algorithm was proposed by R. Agrawal and R.Srikant in 1994 for mining **frequent itemsets** for boolean **association rules**.
- the name of the algorithm is based on the fact that it uses prior knowledge of frequent itemset properties.
# How it works
- it employs an iterative approach
