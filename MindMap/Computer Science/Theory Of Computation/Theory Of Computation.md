- **Theory of Computation** is a branch of computer science and mathematics concerned with understanding the limitations of computing machines.
- **Computation** is the process of performing calculations or solving problems through a series of well-defined steps (IE, an algorithm).
# Importance of Computation theory
- **Defining limits of *Computation***: helps to avoid wasting resources (time, memory ... etc) on problems unsolvable by *Computation*.
- **Optimizing Algorithms Efficiency**: *Complexity Theory* categorizes problems based on resources needed to solve it (P, NP, NP-hard, NP-complete), providing guidance to decide whether to seek exact solutions or focus on approximations.
- **Enabling Practical Software and System Designs**: *Automata Theory* is foundational in designing programming languages and compilers and allows the creation of more reliable and optimized software systems.
- **Strengthening Cryptography and Security**: Understanding the limits of computation can help in designing secure and hard-to-break encryption systems.
- **Guiding Innovation in Emerging Technologies**: Helps defining the capabilities and limitations of new emerging computational models (like quantum computing), allowing us to design new algorithms that leverage these computational models, pushing the boundaries of what is possible.
# Languages and Grammers
- **Alphabet**: is a set of symbols. In Automata Theory, it represents the set of inputs.
- **String**: a finite concatenation of elements from the **Alphabet**. In Automata Theory, it represents the sequence of inputs.
- **Formal Language**: a set of **strings** over an alphabet.
- **Regular Language**: can be recognized by finite automata and described using regular expressions.
- **Context-Free Language:
