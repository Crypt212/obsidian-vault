- a **Pumping [[lemma]]** fundamental tools in **theory of computation** used prove that a language does not belong to specific language classes.
- these [[lemma|lemmas]] provide a property that all languages of specific class must satisfy.
- if the language in test does not satisfy then it is proven to not be of that class.
# Term Analogy (Why "pumping")
- 
for Regular Languages**: this is used to prove that a given
language is not regular. It provides a property that all regular language must satisfy, and if a language does not satisfy this, it is not regular.
- **Pumping Lemma for Context-Free Languages**: similar to the regular pumping lemma, this is used to show that a language is not context-free
