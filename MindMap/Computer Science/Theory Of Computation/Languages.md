# Language Types
## Natural Language
- is the language we speak and right everyday.
- **KEY CHARACTERISTICS**:
	- **Ambiguity**: a sentence can have multiple meanings.
	- **Vagueness**: imprecise boundaries and measurements that depend on context. (ex. "tall", "rich", "soon")
	- **No Extra Learning**: mostly learned in childhood.
	- **High Expressiveness**: can discuss abstract concepts, emotions, hypotheticals.
	- **Consistency Hard to Check**: Contradictory rules, Dialectical variations
## Formal Language
- a language with precise defined set of grammatical rules.
- its syntax is defined mathematically, without and inherent meaning (semantics).
- **KEY CHARACTERISTICS**:
	- **Precise Syntax**: the rules for forming a string are strict and unambiguous.
	- **No Ambiguity**: a valid string in the language has only one valid structure.
	- **Context-Independent**: The rules always apply regardless of the situation.
	- **Mathematical Representation**: defined using tools like [[Automata]] and Grammars.
### [[Regular Languages]]
- formal languages recognized by finite automata and described using regular expressions.
### [[Context-Free Grammars|Context-Free Languages]]
- formal languages that can be generated by [[context-free grammars]] and are recognized by [[pushdown automata]] (they require memory and recursive calls, which [[regular languages]] can't handle).
# Operations on Languages
- languages can be combined and manipulated using various operations:
- **Union ($L1 ∪ L2$)**: All strings in either $L1$ or $L2$.
- **Intersection ($L1 ∩ L2$)**: All strings that are in both $L1$ and $L2$.
- **Concatenation ($L1 · L2$)**: All strings formed by concatenating a string from $L1$ with a string from $L2$.
- **Kleene Star ($L^*$)**: All strings formed by concatenating zero or more strings from $L$.
