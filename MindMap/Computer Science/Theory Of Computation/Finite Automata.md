- **Finite automata (FA)** are one of the most fundamental computational models used in the study of [[languages|formal languages]] and automata theory. They are used to recognize and classify patterns within input data, and are essential for understanding [[regular languages]].
- Finite automata operate on strings of symbols from a given alphabet and decide whether the input string belongs to a particular language.
- Finite automata are characterized by a finite number of states, and they make state transitions based on input symbols.
- There are two types of Finite Automata:-
	- Deterministic Finite Automate (DFA)
	- Non-deterministic Finite Automate (NFA)
- Both DFA and NFA recognize the same class of languages, known as the [[regular languages]].
# Formalization
- a Finite Automata is defined as a 5-tuple: $M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$, where:
	- $Q$ is the set of states
	- $\Sigma$ is a finite input alphabet.
	- $\delta: Q \times \Sigma \rightarrow Q$ is a transition function; a mapping that defines what is the new state $q_{new}$ resulting from current state
