- **Finite automata (FA)** are one of the most fundamental computational models used in the study of [[languages|formal languages]] and automata theory. They are used to recognize and classify patterns within input data, and are essential for understanding [[regular languages]].
- Finite automata operate on strings of symbols from a given alphabet and decide whether the input string belongs to a particular language.
- Finite automata are characterized by a finite number of states, and they make state transitions based on input symbols.
# Types of Finite Automata
- Both DFA and NFA recognize the same class of languages, known as the [[regular languages]].
## Deterministic Finite Automate (DFA)

## Non-deterministic Finite Automate (NFA)
