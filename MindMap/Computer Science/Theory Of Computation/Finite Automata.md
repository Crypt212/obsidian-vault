- **Finite automata (FA)** are one of the most fundamental computational models used in the study of [[languages|formal languages]] and automata theory. They are used to recognize and classify patterns within input data, and are essential for understanding [[regular languages]].
- Finite automata operate on strings of symbols from a given alphabet and decide whether the input string belongs to a particular language.
- Finite automata are characterized by a finite number of states, and they make state transitions based on input symbols.
