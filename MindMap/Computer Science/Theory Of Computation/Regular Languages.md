Regular Languages: These are the simplest class of languages in the
Chomsky hierarchy, and they can be defined using **regular expressions**
or recognized by [[finite automata]].
# Regular Expressions
- are a formal notation that defines a regular language.
- specifies a pattern that can be matched by strings over a given alphabet.
# Formalizing
- let $L$ be a function:
	- **Input**: A regular expression $R$
	- **Output**: The language $L(R) \subseteq \Sigma^*$ (set of all strings matching $R$)
