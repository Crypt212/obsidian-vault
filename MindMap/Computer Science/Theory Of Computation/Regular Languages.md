Regular Languages: These are the simplest class of languages in the
Chomsky hierarchy, and they can be defined using **regular expressions**
or recognized by [[finite automata]].
# Regular Expressions
- are a formal notation that defines a regular language.
- specifies a pattern that can be matched by strings over a given alphabet.
# Formalizing
- let $L:RE\rightarrow 2^{\Sigma^*}$ be a function:akes a **regular expression** and outputs a language (set of strings) statisfying this regex.
