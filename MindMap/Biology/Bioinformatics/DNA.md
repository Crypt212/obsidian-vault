- **DNA** is the code for all information about any living organism.
# Structure
- consists of 2 strands connected together, each strand being a sequence of combination of 4 genomic letters in the sequence, forming a lengthy code sequence that tells information about the organism.
- the 4 genomic letters are represented by complex 4 chemical compounds (called neucluteads):
	- **Adenine (A)**
	- **Guanine (G)**
	- **Thymine (T)**
	- **Cytosine (C)**
- the 2 strands are connected by connecting complementary pairs of neucleteads: *A-T*, *C-G*.
