- **Theory of Computation** is a branch of computer science and mathematics concerned with understanding the limitations of computing machines.
- **Computation** is the process of performing calculations or solving problems through a series of well-defined steps (IE, an algorithm).
# Importance of Computation theory
- **Defining limits of *Computation***: helps to avoid wasting resources (time, memory ... etc) on problems unsolvable by *Computation*.
- **Optimizing Algorithms Efficiency**: *Complexity Theory* categorizes problems based on resources needed to solve it (P, NP, NP-hard, NP-complete), providing guidance to decide whether to seek exact solutions or focus on approximations.
- **Enabling Practical Software and System Designs**:
